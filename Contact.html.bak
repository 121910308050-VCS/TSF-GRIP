<p>Donate to give children like Kinda a better future
Children affected by conflict deserve a chance to rebuild their lives through education.

After 9 years of war in Syria, millions of children have grown up knowing nothing but violence, displacement and loss. However, org-supported schools in the country have changed their paths, giving them a new opportunity to build their own future.

Learning, playing and laughing are now part of the daily routine for children like Kinda and her brothers and sister. An opportunity to go to a org-supported school in their village is helping them catchup with their learning and dream of a better future for themselves. 

Education for Syrian children in rural areas

These children are trying to leave behind memories of years of forced displacement, loss of loved ones, and violence. org is also providing them psychosocial support to help them cope with the trauma they have witnessed, as well as mine risk education to help them identify and protect themselves against explosive hazards that are prevalent in their war-ravaged village.
Schools mean everything to children. Supporting their future is in your hand.
By making a monthly donation to this org you can contribute to sustain many schools and centers that provide this essential learning and psychosocial support to vulnerable children.

Please help give children like Kinda and Bayan a better future.</p>
